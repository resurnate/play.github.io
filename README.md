# Resurnate Network

## Background

Resurnate is a network of web/mobile apps and services.

At its core, it is a web comic accessible from https://resurnate.com.

The goal is to use "Discord" to build a community where people can talk and hang out.

Other social platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and the like would purely be used to share a strip with friends, but not to build a community around.

Other services are on the roadmap, but the goal is to provide some basic UI/UX experience for the main website.

It really has 2 primary pages:

1. The home page, that simply scrolls and continually loads more strips (using Javascript).
2. If a strip is selected, loads the strip into another page that can embed the Discord widget.

Other functionality includes a privacy and terms of use page, as well as the ability to share a strip via a url.

The goal is to have it work on both a desktop and mobile browser.

# play.github.io

There are 2 types of users that leverage this website:

1. A "player" that plays the game; and
2. A "host" that hosts a game.

All games are hosted by a "venue".

A player must become a "member" of a "venue" in order to see all their hosted games.

# UI/UX

The landing page will assume the user is a player.

It will list all venues a user is a member of.

If a user selects a venue, the current games are listed.

A user can select the game in order to join.

## Join Venue

The user will have the ability to find other venues by name, then optionally join.

If a venue requires a secret code, the player must enter the required code to join.
